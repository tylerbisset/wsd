			<h2>What Makes Turtles So Awesome?</h2>	
				<p>Turtles are one of the oldest reptile groups on the planet. They are older 
				than lizards, snakes and even crocodiles. Turtles are part of the reptile order
				Testudines characterized by the shell they have that acts as a shield. The 
				smallest turtles in the world only grow to four inches and the largest can reach 
				close to seven feet and over 2000 pounds. They truly are 21st century dinosaurs!</p>
